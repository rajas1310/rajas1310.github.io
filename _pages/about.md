<!-- I am a first year MS student at the [University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/). I am currently working at the [SLURM Lab](https://slurm-lab-usc.github.io/) (Sensing, Learning and Understanding Robotic Manipulation) at USC and advised by [Daniel Seita](https://danielseita.github.io/). Previously, I worked at [Thelios AI](https://thelios.ai/) as a Machine Learining Engineer in Computer Vision after completing my Bachelor's in Computer Engg. from Savitribai Phule Pune University, India. -->

I’m a first-year M.S. student in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), currently working at the SLURM Lab (Sensing, Learning, and Understanding Robotic Manipulation) under the guidance of [Prof. Daniel Seita](https://danielseita.github.io/).

<!-- I worked as a Computer Vision Intern at  in Summer 2025 where I developed a 3D realtime visualization system based on SfM algorithms. Before joining USC, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Computer Vision at [Thelios AI](https://thelios.ai/), where I contributed to developing intelligent visual systems. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University, India. -->

In Summer 2025, I interned at [Spectral AI](https://www.spectral-ai.com/) as a Computer Vision Intern, where I built a real-time 3D visualization system leveraging Structure-from-Motion techniques. Prior to my graduate studies at USC, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at [Thelios AI](https://thelios.ai/), focusing on intelligent video-analysis pipelines. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University, India.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, robotics, perception, and deep learning-based methods for manipulation. I’m passionate about building systems that learn to understand and interact with the physical world.
